# etch-a-sketch
Project as part of The Odin Project: Foundations course. 

This is my second project as someone new to development and the second time using JS.

PROJECT GOAL:
Create a webpage that allows users to draw on a webpage by colouring in boxes with their mouse i.e. an etch-a-sketch or sketchpad. The users should be able to:

- Choose the number of boxes they want in their grid
- Be able to wipe it clean and start a new grid

My additional goals:
- Allow the user to select colours and apply those to the boxes
- Sensible and clear naming of classes and IDs
